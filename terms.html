    <h1>Pros &amp; Cons Terms of Service</h1>

	<h5>Effective: March 7, 2016</h5>

	<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") are a contract between you and Pixl8 (the developer of Pros &amp; Cons). They govern your use of Pros &amp; Cons's sites, services, mobile apps, products, and content ("Services").</p>

	<p>By using Pros &amp; Cons, you agree to these Terms. If you don't agree to any of the Terms, you can't use Pros &amp; Cons.</p>

	<p>We can change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub. If a change is material, we'll let you know before they take effect. By using Pros &amp; Cons on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don't agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the site and content will be subject to the new Terms.</p>

	<h2>Content rights &amp; responsibilities</h2>

	<p>You own the rights to the content you create and post on Pros &amp; Cons.</p>

	<p>By posting content to Pros &amp; Cons, you give us a nonexclusive license to publish it on Pros &amp; Cons Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it). In consideration for Pros &amp; Cons granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that Pros &amp; Cons may enable advertising on the Services, including in connection with the display of your content or other information. We may also use your content to promote Pros &amp; Cons, including its products and content. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.</p>

	<p>You're responsible for the content you post. This means you assume all risks related to it, including someone else's reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights.</p>

	<p>You're welcome to post content on Pros &amp; Cons that you've published elsewhere, as long as you have the rights you need to do so. By posting content to Pros &amp; Cons, you represent that doing so doesn't conflict with any other agreement you've made.</p>

	<p>By posting content you didn't create to Pros &amp; Cons, you are representing that you have the right to do so. For example, you are posting a work that's in the public domain, used under license (including a free license, such as Creative Commons), or a fair use.</p>

	<p>We can remove any content you post for any reason.</p>

	<o>You can delete any of your posts, or your account, anytime. Processing the deletion may take a little time, but we'll do it as quickly as possible. We may keep backup copies of your deleted post or account on our servers for up to 14 days after you delete it.</o>

	<h2>Our content and services</h2>

	<p>We reserve all rights in Pros &amp; Cons's look and feel. Some parts of Pros &amp; Cons are licensed under third-party open source licenses. We also make some of our own code available under open source licenses. As for other parts of Pros &amp; Cons, you may not copy or adapt any portion of our code or visual design elements (including logos) without express written permission from Pros &amp; Cons unless otherwise permitted by law.</p>

	<p>You may not do, or try to do, the following: (1) access or tamper with non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the systems of our technical providers; (2) access or search the Services by any means other than the currently available, published interfaces (e.g., APIs) that we provide; (3) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or (4) interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host, or network, including sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of content or accounts in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>

	<p>Crawling the Services is allowed if done in accordance with the provisions of our robots.txt file, but scraping the Services is prohibited.</p>

	<p>We may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the service, at any time, without notice.</p>

	<h2>No children</h2>
	<p>Pros &amp; Cons is only for people 13 years old and over. By using Pros &amp; Cons, you affirm that you are over 13. If we learn someone under 13 is using Pros &amp; Cons, we'll terminate their account.</p>

	<h2>Security</h2>
	<p>If you find a security vulnerability on Pros &amp; Cons, tell us. We have a bug bounty disclosure program.</p>

	<h2>Rules</h2>
	<p>To enable a functioning community, we have Rules.</p>

	<h3>Threats of violence and incitement</h3>
	<p>Don't threaten, encourage, or incite violence against anyone, directly or indirectly.</p>

	<h3>Hate speech</h3>
	<p>We don't allow content that promotes violence or hatred against people based on characteristics like race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, disease, age, sexual orientation, gender, or gender identity.</p>

	<h3>Harassment</h3>
	<p>Pros &amp; Cons exists to share and discuss ideas, not to exact revenge or put private people on blast. We don't tolerate harassment, which includes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Bullying or shaming someone, or posting things likely to encourage others to do so</li>
		<li>Posting copies of private communications between private individuals without the explicit consent of all parties to the communication</li>
		<li>Doxing, which includes not only private or obscure personal information but also the aggregation of publicly available information to target, shame, blackmail, harass, intimidate, or endanger</li>
		<li>Using Pros &amp; Cons features like responses, comments, mentions, follows, posts in a way intended to annoy or harass someone</li>
		<li>Posting intimate or explicit images taken or posted without the subject's express consent.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Spam</h3>
	<p>Don't use Pros &amp; Cons for spamming. All spam will be immediately removed from Pros &amp; Cons. While it is hard to define this content with precision or completeness, here are some representative behaviors we look for that are characteristic of spam:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Posting content primarily to drive traffic to, or increase the search rankings of, an external site</li>
		<li>Scraping and reposting content from other sources for the primary purpose of generating revenue or other personal gains</li>
		<li>Posting duplicate content, whether from a single account or across multiple accounts</li>
		<li>Performing a large number of account interactions in a short time period, particularly by automated means. This includes bulk, indiscriminate following of other accounts (follow spam)</li>
		<li>Repeatedly using responses or other interactions as a method of promotion</li>
	</ul>

	<p>For each of these behaviors, when we talk about "content", we mean not only posts but also any other feature that allows you to add your own text or media. When we talk about "interactions," we mean any feature that allows one user to interact with another.</p>

	<h3>Paid, automatic, bulk, or non-genuine interactions</h3>
	<p>Pros &amp; Cons depends on various user behaviors — like follows and votes — to determine what content to feature and make the site work well for everyone. So, we don't allow artificial behaviors that skew this system and as a result degrade or distort other users' experiences.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Don't buy, sell, or trade in account interactions — including follows, recommends, highlights, or responses</li>
		<li>Don't use services, apps, or arrangements that offer you more follows, recommends, or other interactions on your Pros &amp; Cons account or content</li>
		<li>Don't register accounts, post content, or interact with users or content automatically, systematically, or programmatically</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Copyright and trademark infringement</h3>
	<p>Respect the copyrights and trademarks of others. Unless you're authorized to use someone else's copyrighted work or trademark (either expressly or by legal exceptions and limitations like fair use), don't do it. We respond to valid DMCA takedown notices.</p>

	<h3>Deceptive conduct</h3>
	<p>Don't impersonate someone else in a way likely to deceive people. Parody and satire are fine, but make clear that is what you're doing. Our Username Policy has specific requirements for parody accounts.</p>

	<p>Don't use Pros &amp; Cons for phishing or fraud. Don't use tags, links, titles, or other metadata in a misleading way. Don't link to or embed malicious or harmful code or software in your posts. Don't use deception to generate revenue or traffic.</p>

	<h3>Porn and graphic content</h3>
	<p>Don't post pornographic text, images or videos. There are other places to post it. You know where they are.</p>
	<p>Don't post gratuitously graphic or disturbing media, even if it's not pornographic.</p>

	<h3>Exploitation of minors</h3>
	<p>Don't post anything promoting the sexual or violent exploitation of children.</p>

	<h3>Privacy violations</h3>
	<p>Don't post content that violates others' privacy, including personally identifying or confidential information such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, non-public phone numbers, physical addresses, email addresses, or other non-public information.</p>

	<h3>Promotion and glorification of self-harm</h3>
	<p>Don't encourage, promote or glorify acts of self-harm, such as cutting, eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia, and suicide.</p>

	<h3>Other rules and policies</h3>
	<p>By using the Services, you agree to let Pros &amp; Cons collect and use information as detailed in our Privacy Policy. If you're outside of Canada, you consent to letting Pros &amp; Cons transfer, store, and process your information (including your personal information and content) in and out of Canada.</p>

	<p>We will remove material after receiving a valid DMCA takedown notice.</p>

	<p>We will investigate any use of another's trademark and respond appropriately.</p>

	<p>By using Pros &amp; Cons, you agree to follow these Rules and Policies. If you don't, we may remove content, or suspend or delete your account.</p>

	<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

	<p>Disclaimer of warranty. Pros &amp; Cons provides the Services to you as is. You use them at your own risk and discretion. That means they don't come with any warranty. None express, none implied. No implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title or non-infringement.</p>

	<p>Limitation of Liability. Pros &amp; Cons won't be liable to you for any damages that arise from your using the Services. This includes if the Services are hacked or unavailable. This includes all types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.</p>

	<p>No waiver. If Pros &amp; Cons doesn't exercise a particular right under these Terms, that doesn't waive it.</p>

	<p>Severability. If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect.</p>

	<p>Choice of law and jurisdiction. These Terms are governed by Ontario law, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that any suit arising from the Services must take place in a court located in Toronto, Ontario.</p>

	<p>Entire agreement. These Terms (including any document incorporated by reference into them) are the whole agreement between Pros &amp; Cons and you concerning the Services.</p>
